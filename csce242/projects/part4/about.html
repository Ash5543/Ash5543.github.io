                    <h1>About Us</h1>
                    <p>Sub Stop started as a simple idea between two friends who believed the best conversations happen over a really good sandwich. What began in a small kitchen—experimenting with fresh breads, bold flavors, and family recipes—quickly grew into a passion for creating subs that felt both comforting and exciting. With a dream to share those flavors with the community, we opened our doors to offer hearty hot subs, refreshing cold classics, and a welcoming place where everyone could feel at home.</p>
